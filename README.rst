Devistator Backtesting Platform
=====
I built this backtest platform after building a few in Matlab and Python.  I chose C++ because:
* it's fast 
* I can trade in C++
The second point may not seem relevant but once you develop a strategy that looks good in backtesting you will want to start to paper trade it.  If papertrading goes bad, then you should ask "why is my trading different from my backtesting?"
